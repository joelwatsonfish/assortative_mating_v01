# Version 2 (updated February 22, 2020)

I renamed some variables to make their meaning clearer, and reorganized
the equations to make them (hopefully) more understandable.

```{r}

#
# As a first step, we choose and establish certain constants
meanPop   <- 100               # Average trait value
sdPop     <- 15                # Standard deviation of trait in the population
h         <- sqrt(0.5)         # h^2 is heritability 
nPop      <- 1000000           # number of people in population
threshold <- 130               # threshold used for trait -- only people above it can procreate
nGenes    <- 100               # number of genes (each is on/off)
p         <- 0.5               # The probability of having any given gene being "on"
gene_mean <- as.double(nGenes) * p
gene_sd   <- sqrt(as.double(nGenes) * p * (1-p))
#
#
#  With the above established, we generate our first generation
Genome1   <- array(as.integer(runif(nPop * nGenes) > p), dim=c(nPop, nGenes))
G1        <- sdPop*(rowSums(Genome1)-gene_mean)/gene_sd  # genetic contribution; normalized to sd of population

Z1        <- meanPop + h*G1 + sqrt(1-h^2)*E1             #   measured trait

mean(Z3)
